    <h2> Sources for news that are local and low bias </h2>
    
    <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/">FOX</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.khou.com/">KHOU</a>
    <p> Local sources are reliable because they come straight from the situation because there are people there to watch what happens around the city</p>
  </div>  
  <div>
    <h2> sources with bias </h2>
    <a href="https://www.cnn.com/"> CNN </a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/?noredirect=on"> Washington Post </a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com"> New York Times </a>
    <p> These sources have bias because when a story comes out, they will place the story on the top to show its importance or hide it away to show that it is not important to the website.</p>
